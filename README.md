# Student-Teacher management system
LMS course project that keeps track on student/teacher data

created during learning at Hillel IT School

## Supports all the CRUD operations with data:

- create new records (supports uploading images & files as well)
- read full list of students and teachers
- update existing records data
- delete them

and some more:

- search
- filter records with the course applied

## Quick Hint
use `generate_students` command from your console to generate random data for listing:
```
python manage.py generate_students [number_of_generated_objects]
```
